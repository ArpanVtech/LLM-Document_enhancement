# 📄 LLM-Powered Document Enhancement & Suggestion System

## 📌 Objective

This project is a smart assistant designed to enhance and support professional business documentation workflows using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
Built by **Arpan**, the system can intelligently process and refine various business documents such as:

* 📄 Proposals
* 📝 Reports
* 📧 Emails
* 📚 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

### ✅ Core Features

Using powerful LLMs like **Gemini Pro** or **GPT-4**, this system can:

* ✨ **Understand** the content, tone, and intent of the document
* 🛠️ **Suggest improvements** (clarity, tone, structure, grammar)
* 🧠 **Summarize** documents (general, bullet-point, executive summary)
* ➕ **Generate add-ons** like:

  * Follow-up emails
  * Slide headlines / pitch points
  * Calls-to-action (CTAs)
  * Formal/informal rewrites

This is especially useful for business teams that frequently share documents with clients, executives, or partners and want fast, AI-powered refinement.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Flask
* Google Gemini API Key or OpenAI API Key
* PDF.js if using frontend preview
* Node.js (optional, for advanced frontend preview)

### Install Backend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLM-Document-Enhancer.git
cd LLM-Document-Enhancer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Flask App

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## 📬 API Usage

Integrates Gemini Pro (via Google AI Studio) through `LangChain` or `Litellm`, with dynamic agents for:

* `summarize`
* `edit`
* `bullet_point`
* `make_formal`
* `quality_review`

## 🤖 Powered By CrewAI Agents

Each enhancement task is handled by a separate intelligent agent:

| Agent Type       | Purpose                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Summarizer Agent | Extract concise summaries       |
| Editor Agent     | Improve tone, grammar, clarity  |
| Add-on Generator | Create follow-ups, slides, CTAs |
| QA Agent         | Ensure logical consistency      |

These agents collaborate via a CrewAI-based orchestration layer.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

> Upload a project proposal → Choose "Executive Summary" → Receive a 3-line business-ready summary
> → Choose "Follow-Up Email" → Get a drafted response email for clients

## 🛡️ Future Add-ons (Planned)

* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
* Dataset benchmarking with Hugging Face models
* Editable suggestions via frontend
* History logs of enhancements

Let me know if you'd like:

* a badge-style header (e.g., shields.io)
* deployment guide (Replit, Render, Vercel, etc.)
* a version for non-technical stakeholders

I can also generate a `requirements.txt` or Dockerfile if needed.
